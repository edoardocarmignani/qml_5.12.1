# QML

QML modules from Qt 5.12.1 compiled against MSVC2017 for Nuke 12.2, **for Windows only**

## How to use

* Download the package wherever you want
* To let Nuke and Maya read the package you need the `QML2_IMPORT_PATH` so set it with the package folder

    ```shell
    set QML2_IMPORT_PATH=/path/to/folder/qml_5.12.1_msvc2017/qml
    ```

* Now everything is ready
